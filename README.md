Generates a chromium theme by using colors generated by [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal)

## Usage

1. Run script `./generate-theme.sh`
2. Open chromium
3. Go to `chrome://extensions`
4. Turn on "Developer Mode" in the top right corner
5. Press "Load unpacked"
6. Select "GeneratedTheme" in the same folder with the script
7. ???
8. PROFIT!

However, you need to run this script and restart chromium each time you change pywal colors.
So, make an alias or something like that.
But you don't need to repeat the steps above, just run the script and that's it, chromium will update theme colors automatically. üòÅ
